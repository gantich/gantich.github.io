# Git Trunk Based Development Workflow

Trunk Based Development (TBD) has developers iterating on a single branch that is the "trunk" (usually _master_). TBD discourages long-lived feature branches and lends itself to quick iteration due to its single branch nature. This workflow makes heavy use of `git rebase` as opposed to `git merge`.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** The TBD workflow and this documentation is for informative purposes and is not in use, since it **is not used by any project within the company nowadays**

## Workflow

1. Create a short-lived _feature_ branch from master
1. Work and commit changes there, ideally, these should be as thoroughly tested as possible locally and in CI server
1. When ready to merge to _master_, **rebase** it against the short-lived branch to make sure any new changes to it don't conflict with the _feature_ branch and that fast forward merge can be done.
1. Merge and squash (or rebase squash and then merge) _feature_ branch to _master_.

üí° Every commit in _master_ should represent a working state, if changes are not ready, use **feature flags** to disable them until they are.
