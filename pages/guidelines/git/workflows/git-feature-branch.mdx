# Git Feature Branch Workflow

The core idea behind the Feature Branch Workflow is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the _master_ branch. This encapsulation makes it easy for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase. It also means the _master_ branch will never contain broken code, which is a huge advantage for continuous integration environments.

Encapsulating feature development also makes it possible to leverage pull requests, which are a way to initiate discussions around a branch. They give other developers the opportunity to sign off on a feature before it gets integrated into the official project.

## Workflow

### Start with the master branch

All feature branches are created off the latest code state of a project. This guide assumes this is maintained and updated in the _master_ branch.

```bash
git checkout master
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
```

This switches the repo to the _master_ branch, pulls the latest commits and resets the repo's local copy of _master_ to match the latest version.

### Create a new-branch

Use a separate branch for each feature or issue you work on. After creating a branch, check it out locally so that any changes you make will be on that branch.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/JIRA-TASK-ID_task-short-description
```

This checks out a branch called _feature/JIRA-TASK-ID_task-short-description_ based on master, and the -b flag tells Git to create the branch if it doesn’t already exist.

### Update, add, commit, and push changes

On this branch, edit, stage, and commit changes in the usual fashion, building up the feature with as many commits as necessary. Work on the feature and make commits like you would any time you use Git. When ready, push your commits, updating the _feature_ branch on Bitbucket.

```bash
git status
git add <some-file>
git commit
```

### Push feature branch to remote

It’s a good idea to push the feature branch up to the central repository. This serves as a convenient backup, when collaborating with other developers, this would give them access to view commits to the new branch.

```bash
git push origin feature/JIRA-TASK-ID_task-short-description
```

### Pull Requests

The pull requests process is described in [git/README.md](../README.md#pull-requests)
