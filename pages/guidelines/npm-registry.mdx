# NPM enterprise registry

Install (and publish) packages from our private npm registry (https://registry.company.io/).

> More info: https://docs.npmjs.com/logging-in-to-an-npm-enterprise-registry-from-the-command-line>

## Company enterprise registry

**Endpoints:**

- group (https://registry.company.io/repository/npm/): combines proxy and hosted endpoints. Fetch NPM packages, to be used by company projects (_read-only_ mode)
- proxy (https://registry.company.io/repository/npm-proxy/): official remote repository being proxied https://registry.npmjs.org> (_read-only_ mode)
- hosted (https://registry.company.io/repository/npm-hosted/): repository to host private packages (_write_ mode)

### Registry endpoint migration

It is recommended to migrate from the old alias registry `https://registry.company.io` endpoint to `https://registry.company.io`.

If the project is stil using the old alias `https://registry.company.io`, replace the npm commands below with this endpoint until the project is migrated to the new alias endpoint.

In GitHub workflows, the URL registry secrets should be used based on the endpoint used in the project at the time:

- `secrets.ORG_CORE_NEXUS_NPM_company_URL`: `https://registry.company.io`
- `secrets.ORG_CORE_NEXUS_NPM_URL`: `https://registry.company.io`

## Registry configuration file

Any Node.js project installing packages from registries other than the default one requires a `.npmrc` configuration file:

### Project (read-only)

For projects that only need to install dependencies from the registry (don't need to publish anything): create a `.npmrc` file in your project root (next to `package.json`) with the following contents:

**_.npmrc_:**

```conf
registry = https://registry.company.io/repository/npm/
```

> More info: https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-npm/npmrc.html>

### Library (write)

Projects that also publish packages to the company registry: update your `package.json` file adding:

**_package.json_:**

```json
"publishConfig": {
  "registry": "https://registry.company.io/repository/npm-hosted/"
}
```

> More info: https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#publishconfig>

## Registry users

Our private registry requires authentication, so in order to install and/or publish packages you must create a user. Having npm installed run the following command:

```bash
npm adduser --registry=https://registry.company.io/repository/npm/
```

After successful authentication, an authentication token is created and stored in the **npm user's configuration file** (`~/.npmrc`).

> More info: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/adduser>

### Credentials

The company enterprise registry credentials are hosted in Keeper, the company's secret management tool:

- Web projects (read only): `[wg-it] Nexus Repository Manager (company-web)`
- Server projects (read only): `[wg-it] Nexus Repository Manager (company-server)`
- Read & write: `[wg-it] Nexus Repository Manager (company-ci)`

**Example:**

```txt
$ npm adduser --registry=https://registry.company.io/repository/npm/
Username: company-web
Password: ***
Email: (this IS public) developer@company.com
Logged in as company-web on https://registry.company.io/repository/npm/.
...

$ cat $HOME/.npmrc
//registry.company.io/repository/npm/:_authToken=NpmToken.xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

- Hosted registry (libraries): `npm adduser --registry=https://registry.company.io/repository/npm-hosted/`

**Example:**

```txt
$ npm adduser --registry=https://registry.company.io/repository/npm-hosted/
Username: company-ci
Password: ***
Email: (this IS public) developer@company.com
Logged in as company-ci on https://registry.company.io/repository/npm-hosted/.
...
$ cat $HOME/.npmrc
//registry.company.io/repository/npm/:_authToken=NpmToken.xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

⚠️ Publishing libraries through a **GitHub actions workflow** is preferable:

```yml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v1
  with:
    node-version: "12.x"
    registry-url: ${{ secrets.ORG_CORE_NEXUS_NPM_company_URL }}
- run: npm publish
  env:
    NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ORG_CORE_NEXUS_NPM_TOKEN }}
```

## Troubleshooting

When a registry endpoint change is made in a project, `package-lock.json` may not be up to date and may not resolve on the new registry endpoint.

To solve this remove `package-lock.json` file and `node_modules` folder and perform a clean install.

```bash
rm package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```
